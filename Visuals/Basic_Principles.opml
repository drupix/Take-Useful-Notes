			<outline text="Agile Development">
				<outline text="Continuous Improvement">
					<outline text="Actively seeking opportunities to enhance processes and outcomes over time."/>
					<outline text="Apply by regularly reviewing and reflecting on your note-taking, identifying areas for improvement, and experimenting with new techniques or tools to optimize your knowledge management workflow"/>
				</outline>
				<outline text="Incremental Delivery">
					<outline text="By regularly adding new notes, linking related concepts, and refining existing content, users can continuously deliver value to themselves and others."/>
					<outline text="Delivering value to users through frequent, incremental releases rather than waiting for a complete, final product."/>
				</outline>
				<outline text="Iterative Development">
					<outline text="Start with a few core notes and gradually expand and refine the network through iterative additions and revisions."/>
				</outline>
			</outline>
			<outline text="Attention Economy">
				<outline text="Attention Scarcity">
					<outline text="Prioritize high-value notes or connections that align with your current goals or interests, thus maximizing the utility of limited attention resources and mitigating the risk of information overload."/>
				</outline>
