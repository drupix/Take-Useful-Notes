# Smart Sketchnotes
My first book was about Digital Sketchnotes. Now I have support from my Zettelkasten. Writing a second book in parallel is always a good choice. Working title:
**How to take SMART SKETCHNOTES with Obsidian and Zettelkasten**

## Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought.

## Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

## Sketchnotes
Sketchnotes is a way of taking notes using drawings and illustrations, along with words. It was created by a man named Mike Rohde. It allows you to add visual element to your notes, making it more engaging, memorable and easy to understand the subject.
