# TAKE USEFUL NOTES
My first book was about Digital Sketchnotes. Now I have support from my Zettelkasten. Writing a second book in parallel is always a good choice: **How to TAKE USEFUL NOTES with Obsidian and Zettelkasten**

## Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app from Shida Li and Erica Xu. It works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files and lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought.

## Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing created by Niklas Luhmann. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.

## Sketchnotes
Sketchnotes are a way of taking notes using drawings and illustrations, along with words. It was created by Mike Rohde and allows you to add visual element to your notes, making it more engaging, memorable and easy to understand the subject.
