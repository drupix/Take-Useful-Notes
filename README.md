# Smart Sketchnotes
My first book was about Digital Sketchnotes. Now I have support from my Zettelkasten. Writing a second book in parallel is always a good choice. Working title: **How to take SMART SKETCHNOTES with Obsidian and Zettelkasten**

## Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. It lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought.

## Zettelkasten
A Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
